# FaceRecognitionRealTimeDatabase
This project is a facial recognition system that utilizes real-time video feed to recognize faces and store information about them. The system works by capturing a live video feed from a camera, which is then processed using computer vision techniques to detect faces and perform facial landmark detection. The system then compares the detected face with the faces in the database and returns a match if it finds a match. If a match is found, the system also retrieves and displays additional information about the person, such as their name, clearance level, and occupation.
